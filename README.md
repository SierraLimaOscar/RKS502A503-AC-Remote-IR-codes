# RKS502A503-AC-Remote-IR-codes

This is the reverse engineering of the IR codes for Mitsubishi heavy industries' AC remote control RKS502A503.

It was done using the AnalysIR software (www.analysIR.com) with a LearnIR module.

The .pdf file explains the structure of the IR transmissions and gives an overview of the different command codes. The Excel file is the same information but in more details if someone wnats to work on the math of it by themselves.
